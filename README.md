# micrograd

A tiny Autograd engine (with a bite! :)). Implements backpropagation (reverse-mode autodiff) over a dynamically built DAG and a small neural networks library on top of it with a PyTorch-like API. Both are tiny, with about 100 and 50 lines of code respectively. The DAG only operates over scalar values, so e.g. we chop up each neuron into all of its individual tiny adds and multiplies. However, this is enough to build up entire deep neural nets doing binary classification, as the demo notebook shows. Potentially useful for educational purposes.



### Tracing / visualization

For added convenience, the notebook `trace_graph.ipynb` produces graphviz visualizations. E.g. this one below is of a simple 2D neuron, arrived at by calling `draw_dot` on the code below, and it shows both the data (left number in each node) and the gradient (right number in each node).

```python
from micrograd import nn
n = nn.Neuron(2)
x = [Value(1.0), Value(-2.0)]
y = n(x)
dot = draw_dot(y)
```
